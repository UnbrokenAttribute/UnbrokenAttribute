Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the Federal Institute of MaranhÃ£o (IFMA), where I also completed a Technical degree in IT. During my studies, I contributed to projects such as static page development, a cryptography history project, and represented the institute in the 1st National Robotics League.
